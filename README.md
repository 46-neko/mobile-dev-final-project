# mobile-dev-final-project
This is the final project of my Mobile Development college subject. Have fun! 

Unity version: 2020.3.25f1

This is just a Unity3D project, so you can just open Unity Hub, download Unity Editor version 2020.3.25f1, add the project from disk and compile it yourself.

If you have any suggestion for the code, please feel free to contact me and give your suggestion. I'm here to learn!
